<h2>Let's Face It...</h2>

<p>Video banners can often be a performance and accessibility nightmare for your website's visitors. And when your clients and colleagues are <em>demanding</em> that you implement them, well, what is a weary, performance-minded and accessibility lovin' front-end developer to do? Enter: <em>Video Hero Banner</em>.</p>

<p>Video Hero Banner (VHB) is built with performance and accessibility in mind. Now you can have your cake and eat it, too!</p>

<h2>Simple</h2>

<p>VHB is <em>easy</em> to implement. First, just pepper in a little semantic HTML goodness to lay down your foundation:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="hero-banner" data-banner-desktop="hero-banner-video-lg.mp4" data-banner-mobile="hero-banner-video-sm.mp4" data-banner-media="(min-width:778px)"&gt;

	&lt;h1 class="hero-banner-heading"&gt;Video Hero Banner &lt;b&gt;Simple. Accessible. Performant.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

	&lt;img id="hero-banner-image" src="hero-banner-image.jpg" alt=""&gt;

	&lt;!-- Note: The fallback image is optional, but strongly recommended in event the script fails or video not supported --&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Add the following parameters:</p>

<h3 id="hdr-hero-banner">hero-banner</h3>

<p>This is the primary id for the CSS and JavaScript and is required.</p>

<h3 id="data-banner-media">data-banner-media</h3>

<p>Similar to the <code>picture</code> elements <code>media</code> attribute, a valid min or max width property and viewport size are required. Parenthesis must be included in this value. For example: <code>data-banner-media="(min-width:550px)"</code>.</p>

<h3 id="data-banner-mobile">data-banner-mobile</h3>

<p>A valid URL to your optimized, mobile video is required. This will load on smaller screens, specified by breakpoint value in your <code>data-banner-media</code> attribute. For example: <code>data-banner-mobile="my-video-sm.mp4"</code></p>

<h3 id="data-banner-desktop">data-banner-desktop</h3>

<p>A valid URL to your optimized desktop video is required. This will load on larger screens, specified by breakpoint value in your data-banner-media attribute. For example: <code>data-banner-desktop="my-video-lg.mp4"</code></p>

<h3 id="data-banner-all">data-banner-all</h3>

<p>A valid URL to your optimized video is required. Use this parameter if you wish to load in a single video for <strong>all</strong> viewports. For example: <code>data-banner-all="my-video.mp4"</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>data-banner-mobile</code>, <code>data-banner-desktop</code> and <code>data-banner-media</code> settings are ignored when this attribute is used.</p>

<h3>CSS and JavaScript</h3>

<p>Finally, just copy the CSS (Sass) and JavaScript into your own site. You may modify as needed.</p>

<p>Not everybody likes things that move on the web. Vestibular disorders and epilepsy are but two disabilities that our work can have an adverse effect on. This is why it was important to include support for the <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> media query. This will prevent the banner from playing if the user has enabled the reduced motion setting on their device. In the event that this <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=prefers-reduced-motion">media query is not supported</a>, a pause button has been included in the interface. This should <strong>never</strong> be removed and may also serve to benefit short-term disabilities that may come up for your users. Win!</p>

<p>The pause button sets a cookie called <code>heroBannerPaused</code>, which will be used by the website on return visits and on other pages within the site that utilize the same script. When the video is played, this cookie is removed.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Video may not load when a device is in "Low Power Mode". This is not a bug, but a feature of the device to save power, which video can drain a lot of.</p>

<h2 id="performant">Performant</h2>

<p>There are a lot of different tools out there to optimize your video. For our demo, <a href="https://handbrake.fr/">HandBrake</a> was used for this task. If you would like to use this tool to optimize your own videos, then this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhCHrnfqQhI">tutorial</a> is a great place to begin.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure your banner videos are no more than 20-30 seconds long. The smaller in length, the better.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> A <a href="vhb-handbrake-preset.json" download>User Preset</a> is available to download and import into HandBrake. This may serve useful for beginners.</p>
